In these text files you can find Galactocentric offset, F_light and enclosed flux values for the magnetar, pulsar, young pulsar, HMXB and LMXB samples, as described in Chrimes et al. (2021). In each .txt, the columns are:
0 - Galactocentric offset [kpc]
1 - Host-normalised offset (B-band)
2 - Host-normalised offset (I-band)
3 - F_light (B-band)
4 - F_light (I-band)
5 - Enclosed flux (B-band)
6 - Enclosed flux (I-band)
